When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To collaborate with others or to work from different computers and keep the changes in sync.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Changes someone else pushed to GitHub may conflict with change you are making locally.
