What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This was a good lession to learn to initialize a git repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is things from the working directory that I want to commit to the repository. It allows multiples files to be grouped into 1 commit without forcing me to commit all changes.
