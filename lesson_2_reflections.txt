How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is things from the working directory that I want to commit to the repository. It allows multiples files to be grouped into 1 commit without forcing me to commit all changes.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Only stage changes that should go together. Commit that set of changes, then stage the next set of changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It helps to understand which branches contain specific changes.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
A single branch with all changes from both branches. It is represented with 2 arrows, but it contains the commits from both branches, but the commit history is still liked as is shown in the diagram.
